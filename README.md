# mas_environments

Repository for maps created and used by our robots.

Since the robots have different positions for the sensors that were used for map creation, the maps of each robot are stored in a separate directory with the robot's name.

## lucy

Maps created by Lucy, our Toyota HSR. A mirror of these is currently stored in the package `mdr_environments` in [`mas_domestic_robotics`](https://github.com/b-it-bots/mas_domestic_robotics).

## clean_maps

Maps created from floor plans and/or in simulation, without a relation to a particular robot.
